aevv_puush
==========

little hack to redirect the server puush connects to

requires a web server emulating some of the puush api to work

create a file "settings.ini" in the same folder as aevv_puush.exe that contains the location of your puush.exe and the hook.dll. example:

C:\Program Files (x86)\puush\puush.exe

C:\Program Files (x86)\puush\puush_hook.dll
